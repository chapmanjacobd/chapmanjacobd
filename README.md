### Hello  👨‍🚀🌌🌃

> We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. \
We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.
>_Adlai Stevenson_, 1965

- ⚡ Fun fact: Only 1% of the corn grown in the USA is sweet corn (the corn you eat). The other 99% of corn grown in the USA is field corn which is fairly inedible. This field corn is also what they use for non-edible corn products: ethanol, paint, cosmetics, etc.
