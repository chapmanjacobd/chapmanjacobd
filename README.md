### Hello 🌏💨

> We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of reso_urces undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all. 
>_Adlai Stevenson_, 1965
