### Hello  👨‍🚀🌌🌃

> We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. \
We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.
>_Adlai Stevenson_, 1965

> The recent innovation of the "computerized suit" that can generate a surrogate space around us [the internet], a portable virtual environment, points to future revelation of some "psychogeography" that will be based entirely on cybernetic energy, which will then supplement kinetic and potential energies.
