### Hello  👨‍🚀🌌🌃

> We travel together, passengers on a little space ship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil; all committed for our safety to its security and peace; preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work, and, I will say, the love we give our fragile craft. \
We cannot maintain it half fortunate, half miserable, half confident, half despairing, half slave—to the ancient enemies of man—half free in a liberation of resources undreamed of until this day. No craft, no crew can travel safely with such vast contradictions. On their resolution depends the survival of us all.
>_Adlai Stevenson_, 1965

> [Good technology allows us] the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex.
>_Douglas Engelbart_, 1962

> A good tool is an invisible tool. By invisible, I mean that the tool does not intrude on your consciousness; you focus on the task, not the tool. 
> The blind man tapping the cane feels the street, not the cane. Of course, tools are not invisible in themselves, but as part of a context of use. With enough practice we can make many apparently difficult things disappear ...
>_Mark Weiser_, 1993

- ⚡ Fun fact: Only 1% of the corn grown in the USA is sweet corn (the corn you eat). The other 99% of corn grown in the USA is field corn which is fairly inedible. This field corn is also what they use for non-edible corn products: ethanol, paint, cosmetics, etc.
